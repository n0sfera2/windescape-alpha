# windescape-alpha

Windescape is a sidescroller game that follows the perspective of a college student living in Philadelphia. It's the summer and all their friends have gone home. 
They're stuck working shitty jobs in the service industry and their landlord refuses to deal with the roach problem. As the days pass and the humidity becoming  
unbearable, our protagonist decends into the darkness of the city and their psyche.
